# Blazing Orchard Prototype

Blazing Orchard turns your Blazor project into an [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/dev/README.md)-powered Blazor application by leveraging Orchard Core as a decoupled backend/CMS server using its REST & GraphQL APIs.
Orchard Core is a powerful open source application framework built with ASP.NET Core, providing a rich set of modules and features.

With Orchard Core, you have a strong, fully customizable backend system straight out of the box that allows you to manage content, workflows, and what not.
With Blazing Orchard, you build your SPA application as you normally would, but powered by a backend that provides your application with things like pages and blog posts, and of course any other feature exposed through the Orchard Core API endpoints.


With Blazing Orchard, you can:

1. Navigate to content items managed from Orchard, but rendered within Blazor.
1. Render shapes mapped to components, bringing the power of shapes to Blazor.
1. Consume APIs from custom Orchard Core modules.
