# Blazing Orchard

Blazing Orchard is a modular application framework that turns your [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) project into a CMS-powered Blazor application by leveraging [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/dev/README.md) as a decoupled backend/CMS server using its REST & GraphQL APIs.

## Orchard Core
With Orchard Core, you have a strong, fully customizable backend system straight out of the box that allows you to manage content, workflows, forms, users and more.

## Blazing Orchard
With Blazing Orchard, you build your SPA application as you normally would, but powered by a backend that provides your application with content such as pages, blog posts, and  everything else that is exposed through Orchard Core.

## Features

- [x] Navigate to content items managed from Orchard, rendered within Blazor.
