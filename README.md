# Canopy Prototype

This Orchard Canopy project is a proof of concept to demonstrate loading & rendering of content items within WebAssembly using Blazor.
Key aspects to demonstrate are:

1. Navigating to content item routes using the catch-all route.
1. Translating content aliases to content item ids.
1. Loading content items using the Contents API controller.
1. Rendering content items using Razor components within WebAssembly.
1. Configuring what shapes to display using specific components.
1. Providing a default set of components for built-in shapes, such as Content, TitlePart, TextField.
1. Demonstrating specialized components for specific content types using shape-component configuration.
