# Blazing Orchard

Blazing Orchard is a modular application framework that turns your [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) project into a CMS-powered Blazor application by leveraging [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/dev/README.md) as a decoupled backend/CMS server using its REST & GraphQL APIs.

With Orchard Core, you have a strong, fully customizable backend system straight out of the box that allows you to manage content, workflows, forms, users and more.

With Blazing Orchard, you build your SPA application as you normally would, but powered by a backend that provides your application with content such as pages, blog posts, and  everything else that is exposed through Orchard Core.

## Features
