# Blazing Orchard Prototype

Blazing Orchard is a modular application framework that turns your [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) project into a CMS-powered Blazor application by leveraging [Orchard Core](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore/blob/dev/README.md) as a decoupled backend/CMS server using its REST & GraphQL APIs.

Orchard Core is a powerful open source application framework built with ASP.NET Core, providing a rich set of modules and features.

With Orchard Core, you have a strong, fully customizable backend system straight out of the box that allows you to manage content, workflows, and what not.

With Blazing Orchard, you build your SPA application as you normally would, but powered by a backend that provides your application with things like pages and blog posts, and of course any other feature exposed through the Orchard Core API endpoints.

## Features

- [x] Navigate to content items managed from Orchard, rendered within Blazor.
- [x] Render shapes mapped to components.
- [x] Consume APIs from custom Orchard Core modules.
- [] Menu component.
- [] Shape placement / ordering / alternates.
- [] Embed within an Orchard Core Theme and initialize the Blazor app without explicitly specifying the host URL.
- [] Offline mode (initialize Blazor using a JSON export of the site).

## Getting Started
